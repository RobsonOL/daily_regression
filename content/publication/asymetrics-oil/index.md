abstract: "The aim of this study was to determine if there are asymmetries in the pass-through of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices to its derivatives (diesel and gasoline) in the Brazilian market.
Initially, the future WTI oil price series was analyzed using the self‐exciting threshold autoregressive SETAR and logistic smooth transition autoregressive LSTAR nonlinear models. Subsequently, the threshold autoregressive error-correction model (TAR-ECM) and Markov-switching model were used.The findings indicated high prices throughout 2008 due to the subprime crisis. The findings indicated high prices throughout 2008 due to the subprime crisis. The results indicated that there is long-term pass-through of oil prices in both methods, suggesting an equilibrium adjustment in the prices of diesel and gasoline in the analyzed period. Regarding the short term, the variations in contemporary crude oil prices have positive effects on the variations in fuel prices. Lastly, this behavior can partly be explained by the internal price management structure adopted during almost all of the analyzed period.
This paper contributes to the literature at some points. The first contribution is the modeling of the oil price series through non-linear models, further enriching the literature on the recent behavior of this time series. The second is the simultaneous use of the threshold autoregressive error-correction model (TAR-ECM) and Markov-switching model to capture possible short and long-term asymmetries in the pass-through of prices, as few studies have applied these methods to price future of oil. The third and main contribution is the investigation of whether there are asymmetries in the transfer of oil prices to the price of derivatives in Brazil. So far, no work has investigated this issue, which is very relevant to the country."
